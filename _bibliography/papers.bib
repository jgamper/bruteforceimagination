  title={Multiple Instance Captioning: Learning Representations from Histopathology Textbooks and Articles},
  author={Gamper, Jevgenij and Rajpoot, Nasir},
  abstract={We present ARCH, a computational pathology (CP) multiple instance captioning dataset to facilitate dense supervision of CP tasks.
  Existing CP datasets focus on narrow tasks; ARCH on the other hand contains dense diagnostic and morphological descriptions for a range of stains, tissue types and pathologies.
  Using intrinsic dimensionality estimation, we show that ARCH is the only CP dataset to (ARCH-)rival its computer vision analog MS-COCO Captions. We conjecture that an encoder
  pre-trained on dense image captions learns transferable representations for most CP tasks. We support the conjecture with evidence that ARCH representation transfers to a
  variety of pathology sub-tasks better than ImageNet features or representations obtained via self-supervised or multi-task learning on pathology images alone.
  We release our best model and invite other researchers to test it on their CP tasks.},

  title={Exoplanet validation with machine learning: 50 new validated Kepler planets},
  author={Armstrong, David J and Gamper, Jevgenij and Damoulas, Theodoros},
  abstract={Over 30% of the ~4000 known exoplanets to date have been discovered using 'validation', where the statistical
  likelihood of a transit arising from a false positive (FP), non-planetary scenario is calculated. For the large majority
  of these validated planets calculations were performed using the vespa algorithm (Morton et al. 2016). Regardless of
  the strengths and weaknesses of vespa, it is highly desirable for the catalogue of known planets not to be dependent
  on a single method. We demonstrate the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically a gaussian process classifier
  (GPC) reinforced by other models, to perform probabilistic planet validation incorporating prior probabilities for
  possible FP scenarios. The GPC can attain a mean log-loss per sample of 0.54 when separating confirmed planets from
  FPs in the Kepler threshold crossing event (TCE) catalogue. Our models can validate thousands of unseen candidates
  in seconds once applicable vetting metrics are calculated, and can be adapted to work with the active TESS mission,
  where the large number of observed targets necessitates the use of automated algorithms. We discuss the limitations
  and caveats of this methodology, and after accounting for possible failure modes newly validate 50 Kepler candidates
  as planets, sanity checking the validations by confirming them with vespa using up to date stellar information.
  Concerning discrepancies with vespa arise for many other candidates, which typically resolve in favour of our models.
  Given such issues, we caution against using single-method planet validation with either method until the discrepancies
  are fully understood.},
