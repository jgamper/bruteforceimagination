I happened to have: chopped wood in the forests of Belarus; done graffiti on the streets of Vilnius; 
raced olympic swimming champions; stood among the heads of Federal Reserve Bank in New York; 
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/staa2498/5894933?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">searched</a>
for exo-planets in other solar systems; <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/ecdp_presenting.jpg" target="_blank">done</a> cancer research;

Currently a PhD student at [Tissue Image Analytics lab](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/tia/) at The University of Warwick, 
funded by [Philips](https://www.philips.co.uk/healthcare/solutions/pathology).
Previously, a senior scientist at [Cervest Ltd.](https://cervest.earth/), where 
I built machine learning tools for earth sciences, and helped shaping a research driven company. Now a
machine learning team lead at [Vinted](https://www.vinted.com/) and a board member at [Artificial 
Intelligence Association of Lithunia](https://lithuania.ai/).

My aim is to be useful not just as a sciency-entrepreneur and a citizen, but also as a mentor or mentee.
